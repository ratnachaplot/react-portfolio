# ReactFolio – Personal Portfolio Website

ReactFolio is a personal portfolio website developed using **React.js** and **Vite**.  
The project is designed to showcase my skills, projects, education, and experience as a frontend developer in a clean and structured manner.

## 📌 Purpose of the Project
The main purpose of this project is to:
- Apply React fundamentals in a real-world project
- Understand component-based architecture
- Practice clean folder structuring
- Learn how to deploy a React application

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** – For building reusable UI components
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic
- **HTML5** – Page structure
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **Vite** – Fast development and build tool

---

## 🧠 Project Architecture
The application follows a modular structure:
- **Components** are used for reusable UI parts like Navbar, Hero, and Footer
- **Assets** folder stores images and resume files
- **CSS files** are separated for each section for better maintainability

This structure improves readability, scalability, and debugging.
